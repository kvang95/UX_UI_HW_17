            <p>I am a UX/UI designer. I specialize in user research, user definition, & UI design. I enjoy being able to utilize my user research and findings to create products that can better help serve user needs. I enjoy working with others in projects and being able to bring life to products. I always look forward to learning and growing with the knowledge I gain and applying that to any role Iâ€™m in as well.
